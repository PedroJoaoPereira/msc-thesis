### MsC Computer Science Thesis

This thesis studied a new take on post video processing operations using hardware acceleration via GPUs, in specific with NVIDIA GPUs with CUDA software.
Since the time of writing, a plethora of new technologies were created that use GPU processing for non graphical operations that have a more interesting take on this subject.

This project will be archived only as an artifact of a not so distant past.
